For the last few years, I've not really cared at all about a semi-permanent
slice of home on the internet. I've stuck mostly with twitter and only the
occasional blog post, usually on someone else's platform. A few folks like
[Ben Cotton](https://twitter.com/funnelfiasco) have tried to reform me.
They've gotten me to the point where I'm starting to feel a little guilty
about being a digital vagrant...and so here we are.

I can't promise miracles, but I am going to try to write more frequently, and
rebuilding some proper website tooling seemed like an interesting way to go
about preparing. This time, if I stop maintaining this little website slice,
I'll at least have the decency to feel guilty about it.

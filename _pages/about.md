I'm currently a Principal Program Manager with Microsoft's "Linux Systems
Group" in Azure's Edge and Platform team. My role here is largely to help
drive Linux adoption within Microsoft.

Previously I was an engineering manager with Red Hat's Community Platform
Engineering team where I helped herd a variety of projects, most notably
CentOS Stream.

I've been involved in the Linux community across multiple distributions since
1999, primarily active in the Fedora and CentOS distributions.

Since 2004 I've served as member of the CentOS Board, and driving a number of initiatives
including the early development of AArch64 support for CentOS Linux.

Creating new entries:

```sh
  draft      # Creates a new draft post with the given NAME
  post       # Creates a new post with the given NAME
  publish    # Moves a draft into the _posts directory and sets the date
  unpublish  # Moves a post back into the _drafts directory
  page       # Creates a new page with the given NAME
```

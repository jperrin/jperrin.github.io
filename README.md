# README

This is my little slice of the internet and personal info site.

# Usage

This blog uses the [jekyll-compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose)
plugin. The following commands are what you want.
Creating new entries:

```sh
  draft      # Creates a new draft post with the given NAME
  post       # Creates a new post with the given NAME
  publish    # Moves a draft into the _posts directory and sets the date
  unpublish  # Moves a post back into the _drafts directory
  page       # Creates a new page with the given NAME
```

## Theme info
My theme is a modified version of  _Airspace_ Jekyll theme, which is itself a port of ThemeFisher's Airspace template. It is released under ThemeFisher's free license, which requires attribution.
If you want to use this theme for yourself, I started from here -> [airspace-jekyll](https://github.com/luminousrubyist/airspace-jekyll/fork).
